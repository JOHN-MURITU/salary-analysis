# 🧠 Salary Analysis: Because Basic Data Deserves an Overachiever

Welcome to the **Salary Analysis** project. I used a *humble* little SQLite database and unleashed Python on it like it owed me money.

### 📊 What’s Inside?

- 🔍 SQL extraction and wrangling (I talk to data like it’s my intern)
- 🐍 Python for deep data analysis and plotting (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas — you name it)
- 📈 Multiple advanced visualizations that don’t just look pretty — they slap.
- 📅 Yearly salary distributions, trends, and outlier detections
- 🔥 Automated and reusable scripts. Run and done. No babysitting needed.

## 💼 About Me

If you're reading this, I'm **JOHN-MURITU**, and yes, I’m the one who did all of this from scratch.

> 📍 Data Analyst  
> 🧰 Tools: SQL, Python, Power BI, Excel, Tableau  
> 🎯 Specialty: Turning raw chaos into beautiful dashboards and confident decisions.

I don’t just *"know Excel"* — I do **VLOOKUPs in my sleep** and crush **pivot tables before breakfast**.  
Tableau and Power BI? I make dashboards that executives fight over.  
Python? I write scripts that automate what others spend days clicking through.  
SQL? Joins, CTEs, window functions — I do it all while sipping coffee.
